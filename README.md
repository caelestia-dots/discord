# caelestia-discord

BetterDiscord theme integration for my caelestia dotfiles.

## Installation

Clone this git repo into your discord client's config directory.

E.g. vesktop

```sh
git clone https://github.com/caelestia-dots/discord.git ~/.config/vesktop
```

Optionally run `install-arrpc.fish` to install and enable arRPC.

## Usage

Run your discord client with `run.sh <cmd>`.
Set your discord client theme to `current.theme.css`. Tt will be under a different name,
as it is a symlink to another theme. There will be a 2 themes which are the same, it will be one of them.
By default it is Catpuccin Mocha.

E.g. vesktop

```sh
run.sh vesktop
```
